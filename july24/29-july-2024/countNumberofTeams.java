    Name Of The Problem :- 1395. Count Number of Teams

    Date :- 29-July-2024


    There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
A team is valid if: (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

 

Example 1:

Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 
Example 2:

Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.
Example 3:

Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

n == rating.length
3 <= n <= 1000
1 <= rating[i] <= 105
All the integers in rating are unique.

         int n = rating.length;
        int teams = 0;

        for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
            int countSmallerLeft = 0;
            int countLargerLeft = 0;
            int countSmallerRight = 0;
            int countLargerRight = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                if (rating[i] < rating[j]) {
                    countSmallerLeft++;
                } else if (rating[i] > rating[j]) {
                    countLargerLeft++;
                }
            }

            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                if (rating[j] < rating[k]) {
                    countLargerRight++;
                } else if (rating[j] > rating[k]) {
                    countSmallerRight++;
                }
            }

            teams += (countLargerLeft * countSmallerRight) + (countSmallerLeft * countLargerRight);
        }

        return teams;
